Enlisted here how I explore SSL.

üì∞ Literature

Literature review to get onboarded on SSL, and tracking its progress.

 *Disclaimer: items in the table are ordered by how I perceive their importance and dependence on one another, for better understanding.*
 
 [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsJWOrDn1-M) has an amazing synopsis for SSL, yet alone not sufficient for in-depth details.
